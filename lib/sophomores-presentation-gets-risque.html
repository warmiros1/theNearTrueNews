				<p>Disaster struck for Eric Lobes when, instead of opening a Powerpoint for his Modern World History class, he accidentally clicked on his personal pornography compilation. The class was treated to five minutes of Tom Cruise parody porn, including the famed Frisky Business, until one student broke the stupor, managing to turn off the projector. It took three more minutes for another student to cut the volume.<br /><br />
				Lobes himself declined attempts at contact, saying only, “It was my sister’s.”<br /><br />
				As for the student reaction, it could not be more clear. The school therapist’s couch hasn’t seen more action since the Art Fair Incident of ‘02. Leaving said office, sophomore Augustus Tüt whispered, “I haven’t been able to sleep for days. I have the image of the contorted faces of crushed Hollywood dreams imprinted in my skull.”<br />
					Classmates of Tüt reported that little Augustus was most affected during clips of The Firm.<br /><br />
				Another classmate, Hadley Wilkins, said, “Thom Cruze is a pretty good replacement who looks like a clean cut guy, but--Hairy Maguire-- good God. I’ll never be clean again.” After a hearty dose of Purell, a visibly shaken Wilkins continued, “He kept staring directly into the camera, piercing my soul, shouting ‘I’ll make it Rain Man!”<br />
				According to eyewitness accounts, a revolted silence followed the finishing video. But then, a solitary slow clap started, and students were shocked when they realized the source was none other than their teacher.<br /><br />
				Where the students saw depravity and crimes against nature, Mr. Hartzell, known for his wardrobe of seasonal turtlenecks and popular Instagram account of public library marginalia, saw a sensational work of art.<br /><br />
				“I want to be challenged, because life is a challenge. And Eric’s piece did just that. Talk about post-modern. You know what, it’s post-post-modern. Eric is really pushing the limitations of art, and even humanity. He goes to a new frontier, like a certain Mr. Cruze in Top Buns, if you know what I mean,” said Hartzell with a wink.<br /><br />
				Other teachers of the hallowed institution that is the New Trier social studies department could not be reached for comment. The closely knit group has been repeatedly viewing and debating Lobes’ compilation.<br /><br />
				“A general consensus has not been met. Come back in a couple weeks, or maybe a month,” said Hartzell’s colleague Ms. Pemberley.<br /><br />
				But for Hartzell, there is no doubt regarding the artistic qualities of the piece. “The tainted eroticism was fantastic. What a poignant view on the fetishization of pop culture and celebrity. Every student of mine has been giving me the same crap for years. This was so fresh, so clean… yet so dirty.”<br /><br />
					However, the praise did not sit well with Lobes, who continued distancing himself from the video. “My sister is sick. That was horrid. I can’t even…” he trailed off.<br /><br />
					Hartzell was disappointed in the artist’s disavowal of his own work, but said he was not surprised. “He just flew a little too close to the sun. He saw through the windows of perception and was blinded. But I, nay we, will always have this moment.”
