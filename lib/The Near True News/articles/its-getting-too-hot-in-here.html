				<p> There is a problem at New Trier High School. The education of half the population at this establishment is in danger, and I write this article as a desperate call for help. Girls everywhere have sent in complaints and paid visits to adviser chairs on the topic of the inappropriate and distracting clothing choices our young boys are making. "I can barely concentrate with these boys around, with their Adidas shoes and inventive band t-shirts. How am I supposed to commit my mind to inquiry when Billy Pilgrim is displaying his soft brown leg hair in my AP Great Books class?!"<br /><br />
				Among the most distracting of apparel, many girls have had issues with snap back hats. "Just the way it, like, cups the shape of their heads, like, so perfectly, I can't stop staring! It leaves nothing to the imagination. I guess I can kiss my participation grade goodbye."<br /><br />
				 It seems that many girls are swept away with fantasies by the mere sight of a well-tailored khaki pant or sports jersey. Sophomore Alexandra Brown elaborates: "I saw a dude wearing a bunch of colorful friendship bracelets on his wrist. All I could think about was how sensitive and artsy he must be, and how he would braid my hair and write songs about me. There's just this whole person waiting to be discovered." Alexandra looks down at her shoes and kicks the dirt defeatedly, "Now I'm going to summer school."<br /><br />
				 Not only have these men lost their dignity, but also their respect as students. One female commented, "I barely even noticed boys before this epidemic began. I saw them as completely un-sexualized human beings. Heck, before Jimmy Yates started wearing those tight skinny jeans with the boxers puffing out the back I wasn't even sure he was a guy. I can't respect his opinions anymore, not after this." <br /><br />
					 The male population has entirely lost their moral fiber, and the administration has begun to brainstorm for ideas to stop these boys from degrading themselves. "Expression is not an option for the young men of this school. Not until we can fix this," said administrator Carol Benneke, who has been chosen to lead the task force. In an exclusive interview, Ms. Benneke revealed her latest idea: "Our best weapon so far is the female staff. We're hoping that if they feel entitled enough, we can encourage them to make comments on the boys' outfits. Then the boys will feel so self conscious and uncomfortable that they will want to change. That seems to be the most sensitive option."  <br /><br />
				Among other ideas are for the boys to shave their legs, or institute a more strict dress code policy. "We were discussing grey nondescript tunics. Like in The Giver." Ms. Benneke made it clear that these were just ideas. The only official rule that has been instituted is to have all senior boys re-attach the sleeves to their Green Team sweatshirts. <br /><br />
					While none of these ideas seem to have worked in the past "trial" months, Ms. Benneke and the teachers of New Trier are hell-bent on saving the boys from their own poor choices in self expression.
