				<p>Reports are being released of a tragic incident that transpired during last year’s brutal winter. Several teachers were snowed inside the school and tensions would prove to rise quicker than the layers of snow.<br /><br />
					The librarians were the first to crack. On Saturday morning, they began burning all copies of Twilight in the library to make what they called a much needed fire despite reports that the heat was working fine.  Ms. Cobb, one of the librarians, claimed, "We were getting so cold and so sick of that sorry excuse of a...I mean, sick. Just normal sick."<br /><br />
					The Lunch Ladies proved their ability to thrive in a crisis and prioritize nutritional needs. Refusing to eat the limitless supply of their own Aramark food in the cafeteria, chief lunch lady Betsy Sue explained, “You wouldn’t want to know what’s in those burritos. Not if you believe in God. Especially if you believe in God.” Surprisingly, the cafeteria staff had no reservations against feeding the burritos to all the faculty. Teachers became suspicious of the lunch ladies when some of their plumper colleagues remain missing after having strayed too close to the kitchen. English teacher Mrs. Lang was overheard saying, "They're fattening us up, I swear! I've seen the cages in the kitchen, and the ovens are big enough to fit the entire business department!"<br /><br />
					In an act of desperation, the science department pooled their resources to create a gigantic catapult to launch them off the roof and away from the frozen school. Unfortunately, the fetal pigs used as test projectiles only made it as far as the tennis courts. As the last pig flew, biology teacher Mr. Langston sentimentally remarked, “That was Brandon. We used his heart in the pig practical this year. Such defined ventricles.” Eventually,  the physics teachers realized they didn't live in a vacuum, at which point they gave up on their calculations and the project was abandoned.<br /><br />
					Meanwhile, in the south wing of the building, the Outdoor Ed teachers decided that it was their time to shine. Years of preparation had readied them for this, and they were pumped. After a quick prayer to Bear Grylls, early Sunday morning they confidently strode out to the tundra with nothing but the clothes on their backs and their razor sharp wits. Ten minutes later, they all came running back screaming. They later reported, “High winds and low temperatures made conditions really uncomfortable.”<br /><br />
					By noon on Tuesday, tensions rose as several annoyed teachers voiced their true opinions of their colleagues. Mr. Boleston, a history teacher, complained that the English teachers were frightening their colleagues by saying, “The burritos are people! The burritos are people!” Thankfully, rescuers broke down the doors of New Trier just in time to find the tattered-clothed, wide eyed faculty of New Trier in the midst of voting the English department off the island. The teachers all were rejoiced to go home after such a trying weekend, and they vowed that another final would never be graded at New Trier so long as any of them lived.</p>
