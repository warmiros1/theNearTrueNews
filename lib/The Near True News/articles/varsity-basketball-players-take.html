				<p>New Trier’s star-studded sophomore basketball team has what it takes to take down any team on the court, but it’s a different story on the sidelines. When the Near True News reached out to them for details on the game, reporters were somewhat offput. When asked about the game as a whole, the team’s star point guard Michael Hurley responded with a general, vague and having nothing to do with the question itself. <br /><br />
					“It’s all about the team, you know what I’m sayin’? They played real great out there today. Basketball’s definitely not an easy game but I went out there and played the game like it’s meant to be played. You gotta have the dedication and heart to go out there and play the game. That’s what I did. I played the game.”<br /><br />
					But Hurley didn’t stop at the court. We sat in on one of his classes and noticed that his tendency to comment on events with unrelated basketball banter had spread to his English class. Ms. Smithe, Hurley’s English teacher, asked him if he had his essay with him. He responded as if she was the Fox News reporter: “Coach told me to get in the game and shoot the ball. I shot the ball and made it. It was a nice shot to start off with, and even nicer that it went in. God helped me make that shot. Thanks bud, I owe you one.” Hurley pounded his chest and lifted his hands in the air pointing towards the heavens.<br /><br />
					“So you have your essay?” Ms. Smithe asked.<br /><br />
					Michael wiped the dust off the bottoms of his sneakers and took a swig out of his water bottle. After hawking a loogie into a nearby trash can, he cleared his throat and said, “I couldn’t have done anything without my teammates, you know what I’m sayin’? They’re all dedicated and hard-working and they play the game the way it’s meant to be played. I bleed blue and green.”<br /><br />
					“Mikey, what do you mean by that?” His teacher questioned, increasingly confused.<br /><br />
					“You gotta sweat. If you’re not sweating during the game, you’re not playing. That’s the definition of dedication. Coach wants us to be dripping constantly, so that’s how I was. I’d like to thank my teammates for giving me towels during the game. You gotta go through those towels, baby.”<br /><br />
					Frustrated, she gave him a zero on the assignment. We saw what had happened to Mikey on the court and at school and so we were interested if it had hit home yet. We spoke to Mrs. Hurley who was deeply saddened about this situation: “Every day after school I ask him how his day was. He used to reply the normal teenage way saying ‘good’ but now he doesn’t even make sense anymore.” We visited Mikey’s house and saw this exact exchange take place: “How was your day honey?” Mrs. Hurley said as he entered the front door.<br /><br />
				Hurley responded with a blank stare, “Yes. Blood, sweat and tears were shed, and as coach says, be thankful for your teammates and to God. I follow that day-in and day-out. I went out there and played hard and fair. Thank you Lord baby Jesus.”<br /><br />
					“Michael. Do you know what you’re saying?”<br /><br />
					“Towels, baby, towels. Dedication, God, teammates, coach, God, and of course, Jesus. Ahhhh-men, baby.”<br /><br />
					At press time, Michael was found in the boys’ locker room playfully slapping his team mates’ rear ends and giving them generic commendations for their performance. </p>
