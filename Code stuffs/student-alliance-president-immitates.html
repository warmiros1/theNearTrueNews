				<p>In a recent interview, New Trier student body president Brad Kensington admitted that his role model in life and in politics is the mayor of Toronto, Rob Ford. Admiring his political mojo, Kensington said, “Rob Ford is an inspiration to all of Student Alliance. Hey!” he blurted out, gesturing to his secretary. “More cocaine. <b>NOW</b>!” The interview ended there.<br /><br />
					A week later, we stopped by the Student Alliance office once again to see Kensington and his staff. Standing up from his chair, he invited our news team out of the room. “Come with me,” he growled, glancing around shiftily, “I need to, uh, get some fresh air. Quick. Let’s go!”<br /><br />
					Confused, our lead reporter followed him outside the building, recording the events. Kensington instructed our reporter to pull out a folder, and then pulled out a strange vial filled with a white, flour-like substance from his sock. He opened the vial and poured some of the mystery substance out on the open folder, before our journalist grabbed it back and was promptly punched by Kensington in the face. Kensington then screamed, “I NEED A BUMP! Tight, tight, tight, tight!” Our bloody-nosed reporter ran from Kensington, who grabbed the folder and snorted the rest of the sock residue. He collapsed to the ground chanting, “Coke is love! Coke is life!”<br /><br />
					Kensington called the Near True News Office shortly after and apologized profusely, saying that the only reason he acted up in the interview was because he was “in a drunken stupor.” When asked if he was of legal age to drink, he replied with “B***h, I’m the freaking Class President!” <br /><br />
				In an attempt to complete the interview, one of Near True New’s reporters met with Kensington on the front lawn of the school. He was visibly and completely intoxicated as he stumbled around, finally running into the flagpole. We abandoned the interview as he was loaded onto a stretcher and treated for his injuries in the nurse’s office.<br /><br />
					The following day Kensington was seen shotgunning a Natty Light in the Scrounge. After he gulped it down, he began mumbling in a Jamaican accent, “Hey mon, gimme a Coca-Colaaa.” When the cafeteria staff refused to serve him, he grabbed a lunch tray and broke it over his knee and then passed out. After regaining consciousness, he took a massive hit of crack off the floor and threw the lunch tray into the vending machine. <br /><br />
				In a meeting with the school board, we confronted Kensington about the accusations of harassing a coworker and stealing her lunch. “I would never do that; I’ve got more than enough to eat.” He winked at Dr. Yonke and, not breaking eye-contact, took a ferocious bite out of her sandwich.<br /><br />
				At press time, Kensington released a statement to The Near True News. “I vow to run for office again. I am a role model to each and every student, teacher, and custodian at this establishment!” Swaggering away, he sniffed repeatedly and wiped the tip of his nose. The most amazing part in the story of Brad Kensington, New Trier’s Student-Body President, is that he and his approval ratings have never been higher.
