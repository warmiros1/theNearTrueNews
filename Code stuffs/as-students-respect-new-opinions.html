				<p>Students of Mr. Logos’ American Studies class shifted nervously in their seats last week as one of their fellow students gave his personal opinion on the Civil War. Chad Lambert, a recent transfer student from Polkville, Mississippi, casually referred to the bloodiest war in American history as “The War of Northern Aggression,” and collectively referred to all African American slaves as “the help.” In a class built on tolerance and understanding, Lambert’s fellow students tried hard to contain their shock and outrage. One student reportedly bit his hand to keep himself from lashing out, while another looked down with strained eyes at his shoes.<br /><br />
					“I’ve never been more impressed by the tolerance displayed by this class,” Lambert’s classmate recalled while he gripped his leg with whitening knuckles. “A.S. is about exploring all sides of the story, and Chad is, uh, really helping us in that department. We’re definitely not uncomfortable with his beliefs. We’re really progressive.”<br /><br />
					Lambert confirms he is slowly making close connections to his fellow classmates. “I’m even cool with Louis now, and he’s the one black kid in class. I always ask him ‘how it’s hangin’ before class, and each time he rolls his eyes in an Oh, you! sort of way.”<br /><br />
				Louis commented on the interaction, simply replying, “I’m not black. I’m Pakistani.”<br /><br />
					In an interview, Lambert revealed his experience in class. “I’ve been really impressed with the support. Whenever I contribute, nobody says anything. Some even bow their heads in approval, or pop a blood vessel in sympathy and understanding. It’s like they say back in Mississippi: just trust in yourself; work towards a goal; be white, rich, and male, and success will follow. Why can’t everyone accept that? The amount ignorance is just incredible.”<br /><br />
					In one A.S. session, Chad claimed that slave owners were brutally mistreated by their slaves, who would cast “crazy voodoo spells” onto their “business partners.” Mr. Logos, sweating, responded, “Well Chad. That’s quite a… thought,” at which point he walked out of the room and screamed into a pillow.<br /><br />
					Mr. Logos later commented on the incident, explaining, “I’ve never seen somebody so brave express such an opinion on something, uh, so close to him. Here at A.S., we respect all opinions, even if one of those opinions, say, Chad’s, is followed by Chad yelling at Louis, ‘This brotha knows what I’m talkin’ about’.” A small, acidic tear was seen sliding out of Mr. Logos’ right eye. <br /><br />
					Lambert later commented on past experiences in his academic career: “Before coming to American Studies, I faced criticism and bullying for speaking what I believed. Last year for MLK day I brought watermelon for my World History Class, and I was greeted with ingratitude. It’s really incredible how intolerant school can be. But A.S. helped me develop myself and my relationships with others, and I’m proud of that.</p>
