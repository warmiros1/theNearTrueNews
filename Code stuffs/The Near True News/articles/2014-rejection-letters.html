				<b>Letter #1:</b><br />
				Dear Mr. Dan Lickston,<br />
				
				Congratulations! You have been accepted to Harvard University! Your essay surpassed expectations across the board, and your transcript was out of this world. We are also offering you a $20,000 scholarship for your excellence in... Gullibility! 
				Can you believe that you actually thought you were getting in here? Oh man, I wish I could see the look on your face right now, it’s probably some hilarious mixture of hatred and confusion. We sincerely apologize but this was just too good of an opportunity to pass up. It gets pretty dry around the admissions office so me and the boys were talking about doing this all Fall. If you still have time, we recommend you apply to the University of Gullible. Please don’t contact us in your fit of rage, we have enough students who were actually accepted that we have to talk to. We hope you’ll laugh about this one day, but in all seriousness, you’re rejected. <br />
				
				You just got punked,<br />
				Dean of Admissions
				<br /><br />
				<b>Letter #2:</b><br />
				Chad, <br />
				Really? You thought you could get in here? I not going to even waste my words saying you were denied. You have a better chance hooking up with Sarah from Philosophy than getting into this school. Hell, you won't even make it into our Massively Open Online Course. We have standards here at Great Wolf Lodge’s College of the Arts. Unfortunately you do not meet those standards. On your application, you mentioned you have legacy here. Your family should disown you. I can’t even believe this University is spending money to mail this obvious denial. I could tell you spent a lot of time on your application, so I used it as toilet paper. You are unable to spell the word “dog” and your ACT score was so low, we needed to get on our knees to see it. Actually, we are surprised that your ACT scantron wasn't filled out with finger paint and boogers. You may also face legal action, as Peggy, from Student Affairs, read your application and is now blind. I would say I hope you are accepted elsewhere, but that would imply another school has to deal with your sad excuse for human existence, you worthless sack of meat. Say goodbye to your future. Oh, by the way, that dumb blond Sarah from Philosophy was accepted. <br />
				 
				Piss off,<br />
				Dean of Admissions
				<br /><br />
				<b>Letter #3:</b><br />
				Hey Champion! <br />						
				We’d like to personally congratulate you on being on the path to graduating high school. At New Trier, only 98% ever get the chance to get their diploma, so you really stepped up to the challenge. We’d also like to give you a resounding “Congrats!” for correctly applying to University of Minnesota. Seriously, you did such a fantastic, incredible job of filling out our application. The whole dang thing! That’s something special. So let’s go over the positives:<br />	
				• Your font choice is impeccable. I can always appreciate a Calibri Man.<br />				
				• Your name has alliteration. Bobby Baldrick? That’s so cool. You sound like a NASCAR racer. <br />
				• You are the first person to ever send an ACT score of 3 to our school! It really helped you stand out as an individual.<br />
				• Your two felony offenses really illustrate the struggle you’ve gone through. Really inspirational stuff.<br />
				There were also a couple of things to work on, such as: ­You were not accepted to our school. But other than that, I had a swell time reading the application. Your candidacy is so unique that we feel you deserve better than our school. So many other schools will be at your feet, begging for your commitment, that it is not worth it to try ourselves. There are so many exciting things to do after high school that aren’t going to our school. Have you tried scrapbooking? Or planting an onion garden? Onions are great for your immune system. So keep on rockin’ Bobby, and remember, even if you shoot for the moon and miss, you still land amongst the stars!<br />
									
				XOXO<br />
				Dean of Admissions </p>
