				<p>Senior Steven Bronsby recently took his last chance ACT hoping for a 36. His parents who met and graduated from Harvard Law School were hoping for their son to get a 37. His final score was unfortunately a 27. <br /><br />
				After carefully doing the math, Steven realized he was 8 points away from his parent’s goal.<br /><br />
				“I always imagined myself sitting in my lakefront home with my kids playing in the backyard and my beautiful wife cooking dinner while I read the evening paper. With this score of 27 on my ACT I can now see myself robbing liquor stores and going to strip clubs on Tuesday afternoons.”<br /><br />
				Before his parents had the opportunity to disown him, Steven conveniently left town. “Steve was always an idiot and I always made sure to tell him so. Naturally, as soon as Steven received his score, he packed his bags and left the house. He probably wasn’t looking forward to the public shunning his mother and I planned for him,” Mr. Bronsby explained.<br /><br /> 
				“He was an innocent kid. He participated in the IGGS program and was a caddy on the golf team. He was just really stupid,” the Bronsby’s neighbor said.<br /><br />
				During our interview Mrs. Bronsby started going on and on about her daughter. “Now his younger sister is another story. She is a violin prodigy, straight A sophomore, and is a starter on Varsity volleyball. I’m not saying I love her more, I’m just saying she’s my favorite. Basically Steven sucks.”<br /><br />
				Local police have been tracking Steven and have found out he has involved himself in many high-profile crimes. As a drug mule, he carried Chrystal Meth across the Midwest. He was also involved in the transport of black market items such as tigers, grenade launchers, and counterfeit money.<br /><br />
				At the end of last week, Steven was finally captured at JFK international airport. He was boarding a plane en route to Cuba. On him he had 2 bricks of cocaine and an AK-47 that he smuggled past the TSA. He is currently awaiting trial with his father refusing to represent him.
